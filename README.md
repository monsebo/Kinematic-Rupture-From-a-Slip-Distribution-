# Kinematic rupture from a slip distribution

**This code compute a kinematic rupture from a slip distribution with low resolution to increase it according to a maximum frequency**
**In this code we are using the slip distribution of the 2015 Illapel Earthquake inversion by USGS : https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us20003k7a/finite-fault**

**This code is part of the paper: "Capturing the Epistemic Uncertainty in Subduction Earthquake Rupture Parameters" (paper in review)**
